Data Education is an open learning platform for people who are interested in learning data science in R, Python, SQL, Git, Cloud and Tableau outside their work and study.   

The original goal of Data Education is to improve data skills across all public sectors and non-profit organisations in the UK. We're start at Bradford and Leeds, two great cities in Northern England. 

The project of Data Education remains free to access for everyone and we're committed to update the educaiton materials every three months.
